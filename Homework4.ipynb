    "## Question 2\n",
    "Quantitative squirrelnalysis:\n",
    "a. Three columns in this data have data that aren’t categorical. Which best fit that description?\n",
    "b. For the applicable set of observations, what was the average above ground sighter measurement? Compute two more averages, splitting the first into average in the “AM” hours, and average in the “PM” hours.\n",
    "c. Intro to ‘geo-coding’: The “X” and “Y” columns are associated with longitude and latitude. Create a new column which calculates the distance of each observation to [40.765, -73.954]. Euclidean distance is acceptable here, but in other geo-coding applications, the curvature of earth’s surface does matter. Which squirrel was seen farthest from our lecture hall?\n",
    "d. Compute the average squirrel position in the “AM” hours, then do the same for “PM” hours. Which direction does the population tend to migrate on the average day cycle? Lastly, list factors which might have biased this conclusion.\n",
    "e. Correlation analysis: Pandas includes some mathematical operations that can workon dataframes. Create a new dataframe that only has the columns “Y” and “Above Ground Sighter Measurement”. Use pandas.pydata.org/docs to calculate the correlation between how north in the park a squirrel was observed and the height at which it was seen in a tree. What direction is the association"
